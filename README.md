# Over-Engineered Weather App

This project is an over-engineered weather app, the purpose of this
repo is to demonstrate the ability with multiple technologies.

## Decision-making

The first step when developing any kind of project should be to 
analise the needs of the project and to decide which technologies
are better suited for those needs.

In this case, the goal of the project is tho show-case my abilities
with different technologies and knowledge on the field.

### Front-end technologies

The project's front-end is based on React, as it is the most popular
Javascript framework.  Next.j could be another option, but since
this project won't have take advantage of SSR (Server Side Rendering),
it won't be much useful.

The project has been created using Vite, as it allows us to have more
control over the project dependencies that CRA, and it is simpler than
the Webpack approach.

#### Design

As the app is going to be mainly used in mobiles phones, it has been
decided to take a 'mobile first' approach.

The design of the app is simple and minimalist, taking into account
accessibility criteria like the AAA contras ratio, for the
color palette, which will be also using a 60:30:10 ratio.

To speed up the design process, a css library like Tailwind has been
implemented.

Figma has been the tool used to develop the mockups and the
final designs.
